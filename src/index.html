                Trambar is a companion tool for GitLab. It lets you maintain a
                Facebook-like newsfeed chronicling your development effort.
                Stories are automatically extracted from a repo's activity log.
                Users can also add their own stories, adorned with photos and
                videos.
            </p>
            <p>
                Trambar is meant to be a low-stakes, informal environment, a
                place when programmers and non-programmers alike can feel at
                home.
            </p>
            <p>
                The backend of Trambar is an
                <a href="https://github.com/chung-leong/trambar/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md" target="_blank">easy to deploy</a>
                Docker app. The frontend runs on all modern browsers.
                It's also available as an app on
                <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.trambar.mobile" target="_blank">Android</a>,
                <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/trambar/id1400086001?ls=1&mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>,
                and
                <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/trambar/9p887v1x7nkm" target="_blank">Windows Mobile</a>.

        <h2>Marginally useful information</h2>
        <section>
            <div class="graphics">
                <img class="sketch" src="<%= require('img/threshold.jpg') %>">

                    Getting people to look at what they would otherwise
                    overlook--that's Trambar's main purpose. IT workers are
                    typically goal-oriented. They pay attention to information
                    that helps them achieve their goals and ignore information
                    that doesn't.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not useful is not the same as useless though. Information
                    that fails to meet people's attention threshold often has
                    some value. Cumulatively, it can add up to quite a bit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Git activity logs fall into this category. Knowledge
                    that a push occurred is rarely useful to programmers, let
                    alone those who don't code. It does indicate, however, that
                    progress is being made. Seeing a steady stream of pushes
                    can be reassuring, especially for team members who're not
                    programmers. After all, their livelihoods too are tied to
                    the code. Not knowing how this "thing" is evolving would
                    otherwise leads to endless anxiety.

        <h2>Information of uncertain value</h2>
        <section>
            <div class="text">
                <p>
                    Unlike automation tools, people have a sense of shame.
                    They won't continually create materials that inevitably get
                    ignored. They will try to send only useful information to
                    their colleagues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Doing so is easy when the information was requested.
                    When information is unsolicited, judging its value becomes
                    hard. The sender is unsure of the recipient's wants and needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, someone makes a suggestion on a software feature.
                    If the idea ends up in the final product, the information
                    has a positive value. If the suggestion is ignored, its
                    value is zero. If it involves substantial changes and causes
                    an overworked programmer to blow a gasket, its value is negative.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Trambar's low-stakes nature makes it a good place for
                    this sort of information.

                    Issue tracker is a high-stakes system, central to a
                    project's workflow. Quality of information there ought to
                    be high. When it's filled with unripened ideas and vague
                    observations of software misbehavior, its usefulness is
                    degraded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Likewise, instant messenger is high-stakes, due to the
                    implicit demand for immediate response. When its channels
                    are filled with information that isn't actually time
                    critical, people will start to ignore it. The tool then no
                    longer fulfills its purpose.

                <p>
                    Trambar can compliment these frontline systems by hoovering
                    up all the low-value information.

                    Attempts to segregate information by priority often run into
                    the chicken or the egg conundrum. People don't post things
                    because they're convinced no one would look at them.
                    Meanwhile, people don't visit the site because no one is
                    posting there.

                    When people are working, they don't want to be distracted.
                    That's especially true for programmers, whose work demand
                    deep concentration.

                <p>
                    When people are bored, on the other hand, they want to be
                    distracted. Starving for mental stimulation, they're
                    perfectly willing to spend time looking at pictures of their
                    friends' lunches or Youtube video about mouse traps.

                    The Trambar newsfeed is designed to accommodate
                    non-work-related materials. It actually depends on their
                    presence since they provide the necessary attraction.

                <p>
                    One can think of git events on Trambar as ads on Facebook.
                    People aren't keen to look at them. If a newsfeed has
                    nothing but ads, people would avoid it like the plague. When
                    ads are interspersed among user-generated contents, people
                    will spare them half a second or two. An instant versus never

                    In accordance to Murphy's law, software defects are always
                    encountered by those least able to report them. That's
                    because they don't think the way programmers think and will
                    use the software in ways the programmers didn't anticipate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Expecting such folks to file detailed bug reports, complete
                    with steps to reproduce the bug is rather unrealistic. We
                    can ask them though to record what they did using their
                    phone as that's not too complicated.

                <p>
                    If the anomaly turns out to be user error, hopefully others
                    would point that out. If not, a programmer can easily add
                    the video to the issue tracker.
